# Superstore-Sales-Data-Analysis
**Overview:** This project analyzes a fictional retail Superstore dataset to uncover business insights on sales and profit. Using Python (Pandas, NumPy) for data processing and Matplotlib/Seaborn for visualization, we explore trends by region, category, time, and customer segment:contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}. The goal is to understand what drives revenue and profitability to inform strategic decisions:contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}:contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}.

## Installation & Requirements
1. Clone this repository.
2. Ensure Python 3.7+ is installed.  
3. Install required libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`.  
4. Download the dataset (`superstore.csv`) from the project link.  
5. Open `analysis_notebook.ipynb` in Jupyter or Google Colab and run all cells.

## Data Source  
- The dataset is a **Superstore sales record** (orders, products, and customers):contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}.  
- Data columns include Order ID, Date, Region, Category/Subcategory, Sales, Profit, Customer Segment, etc.  
- Dataset is uploaded in the repository.

## Project Structure  
- `analysis_notebook.ipynb`: Step-by-step analysis (data cleaning, EDA, visualizations).  
- `README.md`: This file, describing the project.    
- `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies for reproducibility.

## Key Findings  
- **Top Categories:** Technology and Office Supplies produce the highest profits; Furniture has lower margins.  
- **Regional Performance:** Sales and profit vary by region (e.g., West and East regions often lead in profit).  
- **Temporal Trends:** Yearly and monthly trends highlight seasonal peaks in sales.  
- **Customer Segments:** The *Consumer* segment generated the most profit.  


## Future Work  
- Extend with predictive modeling (e.g., forecast future sales and profit):contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}.  
- Improve dashboards or add interactive visualizations.  
- Explore pricing, discount, and customer behavior deeper.
